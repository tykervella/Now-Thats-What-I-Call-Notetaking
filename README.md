## DESCRIPTION

Week 11 Challenger for Full-Stack Programming bootcamp at the University of Washington in partnership with edX. This note-taking application utilizes Express to create my own server that defines various routes to view, add and delete notes. The front end of this application was provided by my program and is credited below.

## INSTALLATION 

If you are viewing this application at the deployed link, no installation is required. However, if you are running this application on a local server, run the code "npm i && npm start" into node to install the necessary packages and start the server.

## USAGE

Viewing the app at the deploying link take the user to a homepage that invites them to take notes with express! Upon clicking the "Get Started" button, the user is taken to the /notes page where they can view all of the saved notes' titles and a form to save a new note. Pressing on any of the titles of the saved notes on the left hand column of the page renders the selected note and its content. The user can press the + button at the top right of the page to add a new note. After entering a new title and new note, a save button appears on the top right of the page next to the + button. Press it to save your note! The user can also press the trash button next to any of the saved notes' title to delete that note.
